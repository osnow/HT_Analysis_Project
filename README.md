# HT_Analysis_Project
Assembly and annotation of spruce chloroplast genome for HT-Analysis course 


This is a project in BB2490 (Analysis of Data from High Throughput Biology) in Fall 2016 under the supervision of Lars Arvestad. 

In this project we will assemble the spruce chloroplast genome from illumina read data for the whole spruce genome using computing resources on the UPPMAX cluster. After assembling, we will extract the chlor. contigs based on specific genes, GC content and coverage. We will then create a genome model with annotations and visualize it. We will also make efforts to assess the quality of our assembly. 

This repository includes a personal project journal containing logs of all project work as well as any accompanying scripts or relevant figures.

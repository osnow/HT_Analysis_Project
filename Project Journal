First Entry! 

I have read the projet instructions sent by Lars and have begun to explore some of the possible tools to use (mummer, assemblers, draw tools etc).
I have also begun to read the paper on the draft spruce genome published by researchers from Scilife for some background. 

Will be meeting with my group members soon to hash out a plan for beginning the project.

First Entry! 

I have read the projet instructions sent by Lars and have begun to explore some of the possible tools to use (mummer, assemblers, draw tools etc).
I have also begun to read the paper on the draft spruce genome published by researchers from Scilife for some background. 

Will be meeting with my group members soon to hash out a plan for beginning the project.

Met today before the seminar with my group members to discuss preliminary plans for the project and layout the different steps. 
We looked into different assemblers available to use and thought that SOAPdenovo or velvet may be good options as they are applicable to different types of genomes and seem to be fast and accurate. 
We talked about how to use mummer for extracting contigs specific to chloroplast and how to use blast to search for genes. 
We also thought about using FRC to assess the quality of our assembly as well as such metrics like N50.

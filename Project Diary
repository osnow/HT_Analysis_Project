Oliver Snow's Diary

We received our dataset yesterday and had the second seminar session for the projects. Our data is one fastq file containing alternating paired reads from nuclear, mitochondria and chloroplast. 
According to Lars, it will be a majority of nuclear DNA but the only DNA with enough coverage to assemble will be chloroplast DNA. We can then assume that most of our contigs will be chloroplast. However, we will have to still use a method to extract the contigs, either using NUCmer or BLAST. 
I attempted to run SOAPdenovo, but unfortunately it will only take paired reads in one file if it is a regular fasta file. I started looking at converting the file from fastq to fasta or to separate the reads into two separate files.
When I looked at the file though, I noticed that the reads were not interleaved as they should be. I brought this to Lars' attention and apparently we received the wrong file.
I look forward to getting the next file and hopefully I can easily run this in SOAP.

Still waiting to get our dataset so in the meantime I have been looking into how to use SOAPdenovo as this will be our chosen assembler. I think we will also try ABySS to try to compare assemblers. I have been reading about how to make our config file for running the assembler and they provide a template on their website, however, it is difficult to know what to change until we have our data. 
I have also been thinking about how we will extract the chloroplast contigs from the assembly and was reading into the mummer package. It seems like we might be able to use the NUCmer sub module to align our assembled contigs with a chloroplast reference genome as it was stated that these genes are well conserved. In this way we could get those contigs that are chloroplast. It seems like NUCmer is pretty straightforward to run but I am not sure what the output will be, as in whether we just get an alignment or if we can extract the whole contigs. We could possibly do some filtering before running NUCmer as well by controlling for GC content or coverage as this would reduce the memory load for NUCmer and maybe make our alignment better. 
And for genome annotation we can probably just use blast along with the refseq for the chloroplast genome but that is far away at this point.

Met today before the seminar with my group members to discuss preliminary plans for the project and layout the different steps. 
We looked into different assemblers available to use and thought that SOAPdenovo or velvet may be good options as they are applicable to different types of genomes and seem to be fast and accurate. 
We talked about how to use mummer for extracting contigs specific to chloroplast and how to use blast to search for genes. 
We also thought about using FRC to assess the quality of our assembly as well as such metrics like N50.

First Entry! 

I have read the projet instructions sent by Lars and have begun to explore some of the possible tools to use (mummer, assemblers, draw tools etc).
I have also begun to read the paper on the draft spruce genome published by researchers from Scilife for some background. 

Will be meeting with my group members soon to hash out a plan for beginning the project.
